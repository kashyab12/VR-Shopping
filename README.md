# VR-Shopping

### Problem Statement
With the rise of online shopping, going out to purchase things is no longer an activity that many people feel obligated to do. However, online shopping in its current state is uninformative because the buyer cannot visualize how the product will look like when it arrives at their door. They can only look at the product through professionally doctored photos. Often, the product comes broken or not as they expect, and a lengthy return process has to be initiated before the buyer gets what they want. Recognizing the need for buyers to be better informed on what to expect when purchasing a product remotely, the team has set out to help produce a better virtual reality (VR) shopping environment. A user can observe the product from all perspectives.
